### `Context:`
This static comp was created for aa Turing FE Mod 2 project. We were required to pick a layout from two options and match it. The content could be whatever we would like so I used it as an opportunity to design a website for myself.

### `Technology Used:`
Only HTML and CSS were used for to create the comp. The design was created in Figma. This will be hosted on GitHub pages and reside in a GitHub repository.

### `Wins`:
I loved experimenting with sizing elements with dynamic values to create responsiveness. I also added a breakpoint to allow mobile users to view all content in an appealing format that preserves the design.


### `Future Additions`
This eventually will become my personal website so there is a ton of work ahhead on this! I'd like to add more responsiveness and dial in the mobile view.
